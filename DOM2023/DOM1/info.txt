Difference between website and webapplication

         It's primarily static 
         It is meant for displaying content like text, images, and videos. 
         Examples include blogs, news websites, and company homepages.
         html & css suffice.


Webapplication :a software program that you can use on the internet.
                It's interactive and allows users to perform 4 CRUD operations.
                Web applications can be quite dynamic
                can include features like user accounts, databases, and complex functionality.
                Examples include online games, social media platforms, 
                Facebook, Whatsapp and online shopping websites.
